# WooCommerce-Perfect-Audience-Tracking
Setup Revenue and Order ID tracking using Perfect Audience and WooCommerce.

1. Place the perfect-audience.js file into you js directory. 
<br>**For this project I created a child theme and created a directory call js/ to store my file**
2. Edit your functions.php file and add the tracking addition to it.
<br>**Remember to add your orders received page-id-####. Also note you must have permalinks on**
3. Check to make sure the js is showing on all pages
4. YOU'RE DONE!!


Note: I have added an additional file with other ways to grab your order id if you are not using permalinks.
